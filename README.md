# 7 Core Building Blocks of AI Agents  

## What I Learned While Building AI Applications  

After experimenting with many frameworks and speaking with developers, one thing stood out to me: most frameworks aren’t actually being used in production.  

The AI products that really work are usually built on custom components. They don’t rely on the idea of giving an LLM full control. Instead, they use regular software for most parts, and only bring in an LLM where it truly adds value.  

The truth is simple: you don’t want your LLM deciding everything. It should only handle what it’s best at - reasoning with context  while the rest should be managed by good, deterministic code.  

Here’s what I found works best:  

- Break down the problem into small, manageable parts  
- Solve each one with solid software practices  
- Use an LLM only when nothing else will do the job  

LLM calls are powerful, but they’re also costly and unpredictable. You want to use them sparingly, and always with the right context prepared. That means cleaning up inputs, structuring data, and guiding the model so its output is actually useful.  

Most “AI agents” are really just workflows. Think of them as step-by-step processes where only a few steps involve AI. The rest is just normal code.

## The 7 Building Blocks  

Here are the seven essentials I now use to design any AI system. If you take a large problem, break it down, and combine these blocks, you can build almost any useful agent.  

### 1. Intelligence  
The actual AI step. This is the LLM call where text goes in and text comes out. Without this, you just have regular software.  

### 2. Memory  
AI models don’t remember past interactions by themselves. You need to manage and pass along the context so conversations or tasks make sense over time.  

### 3. Tools  
Real systems need more than text. Tools let your code call APIs, update databases, or fetch files when the LLM decides it needs them.  

### 4. Validation  
Since LLMs can be inconsistent, it’s important to check their outputs against rules or schemas. This makes sure your system doesn’t break when the response is messy.  

### 5. Control  
Not everything should be decided by AI. Simple if-else logic, routing, and business rules should still drive the majority of workflows.  

### 6. Recovery  
Things will fail — from API errors to bad responses. Handling errors, retries, and fallbacks is critical for production-ready AI systems.  

### 7. Feedback  
Sometimes a human should review the output before it’s used. Adding checkpoints and approvals ensures quality where it really matters.

## Final Thoughts  

These seven blocks are the foundation I rely on whenever I build AI agents. They keep things simple, structured, and reliable. The AI part may look magical, but the truth is most of the heavy lifting comes from good engineering around it.
